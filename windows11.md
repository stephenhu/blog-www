microsoft has been on a resurgence lately, not just from a stock perspective, but also from a mindshare perspective, the company has been growing quickly in terms of its overall business (traditional software, azure cloud, gaming, etc), people are starting to believe in microsoft as a leading innovator especially since that monkey ballmer left.  and for a long time you didn't hear about any issues with their windows operating system as windows 10 has been a seeming success, could be that the earlier versions of windows 10 had issues, but i only started using windows 10 recently.  however, windows 10 certainly can't be comparable to the windows vista days, that was one of microsoft's biggest disasters.  but low and behold, microsoft has regained its footing as kings of incompetence with their latest operating system, windows 11!  in very odd fashion, windows 11 was rolled out to limited users, first it came bundled with new hardware and only a limited number people with old hardware were able to update, i assume they were shaking out the bugs and didn't want it to impact too many people hence the slow roll out, it's probably like the equivalent of an alpha launch.  this all started back in october last year, at that time it wasn't made available to me, but just recently i was added to the list and my laptop met the requirements for install so i upgraded.  windows 11 has very strict requirements for tpm and secure boot, without this, you will not be able to install.  my desktop had this issue and i'm still not sure if i need to re-install from scratch or that an update is possible.

however, after using windows 11 for a few days, i have found that it is completely unstable, i performed an update instead of a clean install, and here are some of the issues that i've had to deal with: docker being unable to start, wireguard getting in a non-stop spin trying to activate a connection, finger print reader not reading (this happens consistently after the first successful read, all subsequent reads fail), windows installer locking up, virtual box locking up, overheating while the lid is closed and in sleep mode, there have been several instances where i wasn't even able to bring up the task manager to kill chrome browser and if i could bring up the task manager, end task would have absolutely no response, the only way to resolve the issue was to reboot the machine, but the reboot sometimes gets stalled where i needed to hard power off the machine, this has been a total nightmare and makes windows 11 totally unusable.  i have kept all drivers, bios/firmware, and patches up to date, i would strongly suggest not installing windows 11 at this point in time, don't kid yourself, it takes me back to the days of windows 95 where if you're heavily using your computer, you'd need to reboot multiple times a day to make the basics work.  this is completely unacceptable even if windows 11 is a free upgrade.  i am more afraid of rolling back to windows 10, so i'll keep windows 11 for now, but this has been a productivity nightmare.  seems that the infallible satya is not really capable of pulling microsoft out of the broken software mire, have you no shame man?  this shows direct incompetence even if azure is blowing the roof off in terms of revenue!  and for the record, i'm an investor in microsoft.  what i've decided to do is install ubuntu 20.04 lts desktop as a dual boot option, if it proves worthy, i may even just do a clean install with ubuntu alone, but i feel bad not having recouped my costs for a windows 10 license (this you still have to pay for).
