# pay, pay, and then pay more to play, monetization plights of the 21st century

![All Hail the Atari!](https://tse2-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.jjPH5PtCrMNOmE02L4zcCQHaD-?pid=ImgDet&rs=1)

The very first game I played was probably Space Invaders with my dad on Atari 2600, there was a two player co-operation mode that he used like to play with me after dinner, we'd try to beat our highest scores from the previous nights, dad was a competitor, like me, but there was also a lot of a teamwork.  That's probably where I started my long interest in video games and extends to now as I play video games with my daughter.  As an aside, kind of a strange peak into my father's personality, he was a very strict kind of person as far as I could remember, so for him to have bought an Atari for himself mostly since I wasn't \
but a few years old, shows you that he did have a fun loving side of him, that he liked to have fun and that he also liked technology and gadgets like myself.

Anyway, back then games came in cartridges, you'd buy the console, that hasn't really changed that much from today except that you can now browse and download games directly without having to go to the store and the style of games has become so different.  I can say for sure that Atari was in the business of making money, sure, but the guys at Atari wanted to make fun games first and foremost, if it was fun then all the other things would eventually fall in place like profit.  That formula is super simple to me and likeable, however, in today's world, there are so many companies making games, with so many unlikeable and sometimes tyrannical methods of squeezing money out of you, it makes you a little bit sick, game companies have become extremely greedy and corporate mechanisms where fast growth and fat profits take precedence over much else.  There are certainly game companies that are still like the Atari's of old, but I would say that many are becoming soul-less blood suckers.

I am a huge fan of many game genres yet car racing has been one of my favorites so lately when [Gran Turismo 7](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/products/gt7) finally came out 9 months after I had purchased a Playstation 5, I purchased that without hesitation.  The graphics and gameplay are familiar as with the very first in this series on the original Playstation 1 from 24 years ago, realistic driving simulation with a boatload of extremely realistic cars and tracks.  However, one thing struck me as being unlikeable was the fact that they had changed the latest game to be more of an online game, it feels very much like a bolt-on, as in, this game used to be played without a network connection, you could play by yourself or against another player on the same tv, you'd get this split screen view where the first player watches the top half of the screen and the second player watches the bottom half of the screen.  I imagine they added a way to race against players on the Internet later on, but that never really appealed to me, I was just having fun on my own or with my daughter and winning races to get in game currency to purchase additional cars and upgrade my existing cars.  Mind you this in game currency didn't require any money to be spent other than purchasing the game itself.  However, the latest game requires an internet connection, you can purchase add on packs that basically give you more in game currency, you're able to get away with not purchasing any additional packs, but it would take quite a bit of time to accumulate in game currency to buy all the most sought after cars.  Let's take an example, not even a highly sought after car, but a decent early game car, a simple used Mitsubishi Lancer V Evo costs about 57k in game currency, each race you win (1st place) gives you about 3k in game currency, so you'd have to win about 20 races, each requiring 2-5 laps and probably about 3 hours and 20 minutes worth of focused game play to achieve, or you could pay $2.99 and get 100k in game currency.  It's a time versus money sort of dilemma that game companies love to get you thinking about, for me, the opportunity cost is not even worth considering, my 3h is worth much more than $3, but at the end of the day, it is a matter of principle, I purchased the game already for $70, I am ready to have a lot of fun, hopefully worth more than the $70 that I paid, yet I constantly get reminded in the game, on the playstation 5 systems menu that I could spend more money to do things like backup my games to Playstation Online, you know, that service in the cloud that stores your meta game information for a monthly fee or purchase in game currency to speed up my play of the game, this really makes the experience quite sickening.  Quite honestly, Sony has been very late to the game (no pun intended) in regards to online gaming, other companies have done this much earlier than they have, but this is just an example from recent experience that I wanted to bring up.  The other fact is that you seemingly cannot play GT7 without having an Internet connection, I saw lots of complaints in many forums that you had to connect to GT7's servers in the cloud to download all the meta information about the virtual cars that you owned, this is something they realized was broken since the service went down for 30h a few days after its launch, and the company Polyphony tried to patch this in the latest version 1.08 by probably storing things locally to your hard drive.  Players literally couldn't play the game with their acquired cars whether they payed money or not because the server was down.  Let me re-iterate that again, you paid $70 for the game, but you can't play for 30h because it needs to connect to the servers which are down.  One day, Polyphony will probably stabilize the server such that it's redundant and highly available, but this is just a rotten experience and shows that the marketing and product team probably came from some other rotten studio where squeezing more dollars out of players is as equally important if not more important than making fun games.  These two things are constantly in competition with each other, squeezing additional dollars out of players has an inverse effect on making games fun.

A whole new genre of games emerged in the 21st century where games were free to play, this doesn't make much sense from a business perspective, these studios are businesses first and foremost, they have artists, programmers, producers, etc that have to get paid for their blood, sweat, and tears, but the model would work by either selling in game advertisements, you see this often in the mobile game space where they force you to watch a 30s video feed with convenient download button if you're interested in the advertisement (most of the time not) interjected frequently while you're playing the game, or they have a way of monetizing by selling you what are called skins, basically different characters in the game, equipment like swords, upgrades, some even sell experience points that allow you to uplevel your character or car so that you have a very unfair advantage.  For single player games where you're playing against the computer, this is fine, but when you're playing on the Internet with several thousand other players, most of which are little kids that can't pay $5 for the same upgrades much less $5000, it becomes a slaughter house, this later monetization method is called pay to win, most western studios understand the concept that fairness makes for happier players and presents longevity for the game, yet I have heard of several studios in the east where they basically milk literally a handful of extremely wealthy and willing to pay to win players and that keeps profits continuously coming.

Free to play is not so bad, it's ironically an honest attempt to gain money for work done, you don't pay a dime, and for many of these games, you could play without paying a dime, I certainly have done this many times in the past: Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Fortnite, etc.  These free to play games often times need the large number of players in games to make things interesting, but to host these services, there's a lot of money that needs to get paid to AWS or whatever datacenter/cloud vendor.  But it's these hybrid games where you plop down $50-$70 for the game itself, and then they keep trying to get you to continuously make you pay, that's the kind of crap that doesn't resonate well with me at all.  These monetization methods are a science these days, there are people being hired that focus entirely on excel spreadsheets all day, they tweak the costs of weapons in role playing games to see what effect that has on profits, there are probably thousands of things that they could tweak, like for example, how much damage does this special sword inflict, what does it cost, and what's the impact on player retention, there's a lot of math, simulation, and modeling required for this work, and many companies are paying top dollar for these employees, this never would happen in the old Atari days where the focus is purely on making games fun.

But somewhere in the chaos of game studios evolving into these corporate soul suckers, there's an order to this madness.  This is an evolution of the industry, a game like Starcraft was a box purchase, you paid once, they made expansion sets periodically that you'd pay for as well, and then they hosted things in many datacenters for many years, I don't know how profitable that model was, but this most surely helped Blizzard quite a bit in the olden days otherwise there would be no Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, etc.  However, recently their games have evolved into free to play, but not necessarily pay to play.  In the end, my guess is that players of these games will get smarter and not play into these mechanisations and will start to abandon games where the marketing/sales engine overshadows the game play, there's a fine line that cannot be crossed, and once it's crossed, the players will know, they are not stupid, and the funding will be diverted and rewarded to those that understand the true principles of games.
