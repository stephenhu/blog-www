honestly, when rafael nadal started playing tennis, i really wasn't a fan of his, it wasn't that i hated watching him play or his looks, i guess he didn't really have any extraordinary skills it seemed at the time, he came out of clay courts, like many other spanish players and played as a counter puncher which is also quite typical of clay court specialists, not very fun to watch in my humble opinion, baseline rallies would easily go 20-30 strokes a point, it seemed the point was just to hit the ball back and force the other player to make a mistake as opposed to hitting clean winners.  there were other spanish players of note that excelled on clay courts, i'm looking at you sergei bruguera and albert costa, but couldn't win a thing on the faster surfaces like hard and grass courts.  later on nadal would prove that he wasn't just a clay courts specialist, he would win on all other surfaces and consistently beat the top players.  what's not to like about someone who plays with guts, never gives up on a point, runs down almost every ball?  rafael was always very athletic, had both endurance and bursty speed, and i don't think any other tennis player can compare in terms of biceps size.  but he seemed a little bit different from your ideal tennis player with the long hair, doorags, tank tops, flashy colors, fiery attitude, unconventional strokes, wicked left handed spin, he wasn't your stereotypical tennis player of any time really.  honestly, his whirling forehand almost seems reminiscent of those spanish bull fighters whirling their capes away from charging bulls, the follow through literally goes over his head and whips at the end to the back of the head!

i had to think on this for a long time, on why i wasn't a rafa guy, and i came to the conclusion that the main factor was probably roger federer, how could you like anyone but federer?  federer was this clean cut swiss with precision like a surgeon, he would disect opponents and break them down with ease, his all court style of tennis was like reading poetry when watching him, serve and volley, baseline rallies, he had it all.  but still, nadal took federer on many surfaces, wimbledon, us and australian opens, and of course trounced federer on clay.

but over time, i have grown to really like nadal and appreciate his accomplishments, even though he is probably one of the most unconventional players even more so than andre agassi (don't get me started with that crucifix earing on his left ear, goatee, and literally flaming compression shorts), but nadal's tenacity and spirit, even at age 36, after getting coronavirus and having foot surgery only a few months before the australian open, was able to overcome 5 and half hours of play against an up and coming 26 year old star to win his 21st grand slam tournament which is more than djokovic and federer, that makes rafa truly the goat, the greatest of all time.  on top of that he had to also overcome several major surgeries over his career, for some time you'd only hear about federer and djokovic finals, there was no mention of nadal, but he hung in there and he made his comeback.  and if you watched today's championship game you'd see that rafa had added many things to his arsenal, he's no longer the same counter-puncher from his early years, he hits winners with his forehand and backhand quite frequently, he comes to the net to volley, he's a more all around player, but most importantly, he's still got the guts from years ago that lets him fight through all the adversity.

i appreciate this about him and he manages to do this like any other normal guy, going to work everyday, putting in his time, match after match, stroke after stroke, just a really humble chap.  so with that, my congratulations to the champion of champions, rafael nadal you are the goat of tennis!
