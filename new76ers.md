![Embiid and Harden Era](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0227/r980029_1023x682_3-2.jpg)

Right before the trade deadline for the 2021-22 NBA season, the Sixers made a pretty significant trade with the Nets to land superstar James Harden.  The trade primarily involved swapping disgruntled stars Ben Simmons for Harden and ended a long winded saga that started right after the Sixers loss in the seventh game of the 2020-21 playoffs to eventual champions Milwaukee.  Simmons was lambasted for foregoing an easy dunk with the lead late in the do or die game, game seven, due to his hesitancy to get to the foul line.  Simmons throughout his career has been reluctant to shoot anything over 5-6 feet which makes his entire game more like that of a center and this causes major problems and deficiencies to the Sixers offense because Embiid is the center.  The trade also involved sending Seth Curry, Andre Drummond, and two first round draft picks to Brooklyn, Philly added veteran Paul Millsap in addition to Harden.

## Trade Analysis

So who got the better end of the trade, I think Simmons has a lot of upside, he's an athletic close to seven footer that can handle the ball and pass with the best of them.  In the paint coupled with his speed and size, he can easily convert high percentage dunks and layups, he's not bad with floaters and I think he even developed a bit of a hook shot.  Will he develop his shooting range over time, probably, but the fact that he's played so many seasons already without making many attempts tells me something's wrong mentally.  What's the worst that can happen if you shoot a lot and miss, a horrible shooting percentage, fans and media gripe (they already were without him shooting), I don't mean for Simmons to take poorly contested shots from strange positions, but if you're wide open and you pass up shots, you're not playing the game correctly.  Basketball is a team sport, everyone has a role to play and if you don't shoot, you end up hurting your teammates, everyone just ends up double teaming someone else or packing the paint as we call it, leaving this person that won't shoot wide open.  I find Simmons' logic extremely misinformed, he feels that he will hurt the team by taking mid range shots and missing, yes there are cases of this because a missed jump shot typically means the ball's going to bounce farther and faster off the rim in the opposite direction which could lead to fast breaks, but this typically has to do with poorly contested shots where a player is having to shoot over the outstretched arms of three defenders while doing a turn around fade away from 20 feet, nobody's asking Simmons to do this.   Also on shooting mid range jumpers, since teammates are getting themselves in position to receive a pass on offense, their backs are against the basket which means the defenders are in a much better position to get a rebound, but there are such things like offensive rebounds, shots that hit the rim often times bounce right back to the shooter, so typically basketball coaches will teach you to get ready for the rebound after a missed shot, not sulk and feel bad for missing.  If you start to shoot, a defender's first instinct is to try and hinder your shot, it takes a high level of mental preparation as a defender to say to yourself, "this is Ben Simmons, he isn't going to shoot, just sit back in the paint and wait for the pass or rebound", often times there's not enough time to make that mental decision so it all goes down to reflexes.  Anyway, by shooting when you have a wide open shot, you pull defenders off your teammates, open more lanes for passing, and the offense flows better, guaranteed.  Shoot enough of these and they'll start to fall down eventually.

The Nets have all sorts of shooters, Irving, Durant, they can shoot from range or take the ball to the hole so having a third shooter doesn't really hurt like in the case of having Harden, but the higher priority is defense and passing, this is where Simmons shines.  This dynamic will be better for Simmons because unlike Embiid who likes to stay low in the paint, Durant and Irving will draw defenders out of the paint leaving backdoor cuts open where Simmons can do his best which is dunking.  He's also got long arms which is a nightmare for shooters from a defensive perspective.  So from a fit, this is quite nice for the Nets, but I don't think this trade puts the Nets into championship contention, they're still missing something, a third player like a wing player that can shoot corner three's or slash and dunk on opponents.

The Sixers are already in contention for the top of the Eastern Conference, they remove someone that was costing them a fortune, but not even playing a single game this season and get a superstar that can shoot the ball better than anyone else on the team.  James Harden is the real deal, he is easily one of the top offensive players in the league, right in the conversation with Durant, Curry, Thompson, Leonard, James, Davis, there is a supreme difference in the comparison of Harden and Simmons from an absolute value perspective, but the fit for the Sixers is even better, Harden adds that complementary piece to Philly, he will spread the floor and cause less pressure on Embiid.  In consolation, Harden has never played with any center of Embiid's ability, typically the centers that have played with Harden like Kendrik Perkins and Clint Capella have been pick and roll dunking machines, they set screens for Harden to do his magic and then roll to the rim for a chance at an alley-oop or put back dunk, must of the work is more on setting picks.  None of those two centers could shoot the ball, create offense on their own, or dribble drive finishing with a euro-step.  And Harden, though vastly improved over previous seasons, doesn't do a great job on defense.

From a trade perspective, I think the amount of players and picks being exchanged shows fairly the value of Harden over Simmons, Harden was starting to gripe about his role at the Nets towards the end and he has an extension coming up in the 2022-23 season which means he could leave without Brooklyn getting anything from it, so this was a pretty well executed trade by Sean Marks.  Daryl Morey didn't fair badly either, he made a great trade and sacrificed some of the future, but Harden, if healthy, can provide a few good years and there are exciting players like Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle that provide energy and youth for the future.  All in all, I don't think this trade puts the Sixers easily in the title contention, typically there needs to be a triumvirate to take it all the way, Golden State's Curry, Thompson, Green, Milwaukee's Antetokounmpo, Middleton, Tucker, Toronto's Leonard, Siakam, and Lowry, the Laker's James, Davis, and Rondo, I don't see that third piece just yet.  Tobias Harris is too inconsistent and more of a third rung type player, Maxey while good, is too inexperienced, Millsap is a bench player winding down his career, in his heyday at Atlanta or even with the Nuggets he was a solid player, but now he's much older, his body's broken down a bit, so the Sixers don't have a third star yet.  And you look at their bench, Korkmaz, Milton, Niang, Green, Cauley-Stein, there's basically no backup point guard, Korkmaz is an inconsistent shooter after all these years, he is prone to defensive lapses, and often turns the ball over.  From all the bench players, Danny Green has some experience, but he's also getting old like Millsap, so cannot provide that energy needed for a strong third.

My guess is that this year Philly doesn't win it all, they've still got some significant gaps in their team roster though this change does improve their chances.  My picks for this year, obviously if there are no significant injuries, are either Milwaukee, Miami, or Golden State in that order of likelyhood.  Milwaukee even though losing one of my favorite players in Donte DiVincenzo and P.J. Tucker from the championship squad, added Jrue Holiday, and they still have a pretty deep bench.  Golden State has the championship pedigree, but Thompson is probably 80-85% of his old self, Green has been injury ridden the past few years, and Curry is having to shoulder much more than usual with his aging body.  Miami, on the other hand, has added some significant pieces, P.J. Tucker, Lowry (albeit aging), Oladipo, Markieff Morris, and have managed to keep most of their core, Adebayo, Robinson, Herro, and Butler.

To me, this year is a step up for Philly, though the real opportunity is next year, if they can stay healthy and continue to improve the roster, they might be in the championship conversation for the next two years.
