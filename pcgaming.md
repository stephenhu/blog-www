for the longest time, _longest_ defined as since 2006 (16 years!), i had basically switched off of using windows for work and home as my main operating system.  i believe mac os x had switched to intel processors by then and my employers had provided apple hardware as an option at that point, apple had given up on powerpc and gone mainstream with intel processors.  there wasn't really any software that i couldn't run on mac os x so the timing was right to switch.  linux was getting more stable for desktops and laptops, there were virtualization technologies like vmware fusion, and more and more of my development was being done on linux.

windows xp came out around 2005 and it was only because work provided me with a dell laptop that i used this.  it wasn't bad relatively speaking, xp was a huge leap forward for microsoft compared to windows 2000 and windows 98, but i also remember there being a lot of viruses that would be unleashed on windows xp.  and microsoft had and still has to this day this way of just forcing incompatibility on the world, like the fact that it uses newlines and carriage returns instead of just newlines, file paths use a backslash instead of forward slash, internet explorer had all sorts of nuances that annoyed me like standard html tags that worked in every other browser except internet explorer.

it wasn't until last year that i had started to move back towards using windows and it was more out of necessity.  i was quite pleased with mac os x's stability and usefulness, but i had joined a gaming startup and for the gaming world, windows is still king.  for example, if you search for linux games on steam and then do the same search for windows games, you'll find at least a 4-10x difference in numbers.  games on mac os x are a little bit more numerous than linux, but not by much.  and it totally makes sense, most people aren't running linux on their home desktops and laptops, it's most likely either windows or mac os x, so gaming companies cater to these platforms.  it's not terribly much work to port from these platforms, i guess it depends on which frameworks and technologies you use for your games, but there's cost associated with porting and mostly testing for various platforms.  plus mobile had gotten so interesting, that probably superceded linux and mac os x testing.

i think mac os x also had this thing with gpu drivers being a pain to develop for, i don't remember the particulars, but there were portions of the mac os x kernel that prevented you from entirely using nvidia's gpu drivers, so you had to also do some updates to the bsd kernel as well.  i don't know if it was a license issue or intellectual property or what, i mean, mac hardware typically is pretty limited, you can't diy and add any gpu that you want.  so i think this has been what has made gaming on windows thrive.  there's probably a large contingency of overclockers and diy'ers that want to customize their rigs with rgb lights, the latest and greatest gpu's, coolers, and gaming really requires every bit of performance that you squeeze out.

and not to mention, epic games has been in a lawsuit with apple about the app store recently which means my favorite game of all time, fortnite, cannot be played on mac os x, or they haven't updated the mac os x version for months.

windows is the king of gaming platforms for pc.  laptops, on the other hand, windows also has a dominant position for many of the same reasons as desktop, but here i wanted to speak my peace about gaming on laptops in general.  laptops do not have very effective cooling mechanisms, the use case for laptops is typically for portability, bring it with you on the subway, to starbucks, to the beach, so naturally space is limited, that forces you to use smaller fans, and everyone knows that smaller fans means that the fan noise will be obnoxiously louder than larger fans like the ones in your desktop.  the fact that the keyboard is embedded in this piece of machinery, the laptop, means that much of this heat from the cpu, gpu, hard drive, and memory is going to get absorbed into the keyboard, tsss, watch out!!  water cooling is relatively mainstream now, but have you seen the size of the pump that needs to get fitted into a desktop to circulate water around a desktop?  that's not going to fit into a laptop at least at this point in time.  (almost seems like a wonderful business opportunity to build water cooling for laptops).

so when you play some of these 4k, 3d multiplayer games where every millisecond counts, that means all of your resources are getting maxed out, fans are blowing full throttle, that keyboard is basically melting down, and noise from those fans are cutting into your gaming experience.  and since everything's moving at full throttle, you'll need to be plugged in, battery life is too risky if you're in a battle royale game striving for the top placement.  gaming on laptops is just not worth it.  there are cases where people have fixed their laptops and use it almost like a desktop, portability is not a requirement, but you might as well get a desktop, they have more power, better cooling, are cheaper, and you can attach a much better monitor to those.

the latest laptop spec'd gpu's from nvidia are gtx 3090, but these are not the same as the ones you get for desktops, they're underclocked to keep the thermal limits feasible on laptops with poor cooling and underwhelming power.  so why bother?

you'd think that for graphics cards, these things have been around since the 90s (diamond stealth 3d voodoo anyone?), you'd think they'd have plateaued kind of like cpu's where you could get by with a middle of the road processor for most tasks like email, web browsing, and video, i mean 4k video seems to run fine on my arm processor for my mobile phone, but gaming, oh man gaming, is a much different story, we are still at the pinnacle, every bit of juice is being squeezed out of modern hardware as games become more immersive, much more realistic, and have more and more people in worlds playing together.

so i didn't plop down and spend a fortune by going for msi, alienware, asus, or razer laptops with nvidia gtx 3080 gpus, it just didn't make much sense.  instead, i went for a thinkpad x13 with a ryzen processor and built in radeon apu.  i don't really play games on this machine, i mean i've tried, but the laptop basically feels like it's on the verge of melting, the fans get loud, and even still, i cannot squeeze out top settings on the games i like to play (you can toggle the superiority of the graphics to leverage lesser hardware i.e. lower the graphic detail to keep gameplay crisp), but why would you do that, it really defeats the purpose.  so desktops, diy, and windows are still kings of pc gaming.  if you're smart you'll buy a console which has the same components as a modern day pc, but costs a fraction of the price, and you can attach the same peripherals like keyboards and mice.

but ultimately i feel like the gpu companies are going in the same direction as the pentium 4 era, just max out power and frequency to get the fastest performance at the expense of wasting power.  intel and amd got smarter and stopped with all the moore's law non-sense and came up with the idea that what we really should be innovating on is more throughput utilizing less power.  when will the gpu company's ever learn from history's mistakes?  by the time nvidia comes out with the gtx 4090, you'll probably need a mini transformer in your house to power that thing.

but where there are challenges there are opportunities for disruption.  think of a laptop that you can use for immersive game play, but at a lower power envelope, that would be a game changer.  don't tell me about nintendo switch either, if you think switch graphics are superior, you need to update your glasses.  and these streaming game services where you use a thin client to talk to a cloud server, that technology's not good enough for that millisecond processing needed by realtime games, at least it doesn't appear cheap enough and optimized enough for massive adoption.
